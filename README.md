# GVPT 388L Analysis Code

Simple code that counts public high schools in each Maryland county.

Used to help generate a figure for my final project in this class.

Works with the "NCES School Directory" files downloadable from [here](http://msp2016.msde.state.md.us/downloadindex.aspx?K=99AAAA) in the MSDE "Report Card."
The ZIP archive you can download from this site only contains an XLS file
(readable in a spreadsheet program like LibreOffice Calc, or Excel).
You should be able to use one of these programs to load the desired XLs file
and save it as a CSV file (using semicolons as field delimiters).

Also if the output CSV file has a different name, you should adjust the line
in the script that loads the CSV file accordingly.
